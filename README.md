# plotsOfDifferences: Visualize Mean and Median Differences in Data

#### Use app online: __[www.shinyappstore.com/a/plotsOfDifferences](https://shinyappstore.com/a/plotsOfDifferences)__

plotsOfDifferences is an application designed to create visual representations of the differences between the mean or median of selected conditions and a reference condition. This approach utilizes effect size measurements, offering advantages over traditional null-hypothesis tests for sample comparisons. By plotting both raw data and statistics, PlotsOfDifferences enhances transparency and interpretation. Users can customize the presentation of data and statistics through transparency adjustments. Additionally, the app quantifies differences in central tendency, requiring the definition of a reference condition, which is user-modifiable. Bootstrap sampling generates 95% confidence intervals for differences, providing a comprehensive comparison tool for experimental conditions.
